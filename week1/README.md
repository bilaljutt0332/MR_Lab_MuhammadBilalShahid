Setting up the ROS 2 Humble environment on my HP Notebook provided a comprehensive introduction to Linux-based robotics development.
I gained practical understanding of how setup.py functions as a critical bridge between Python source code and the ROS 2 ecosystem.
Navigating the directory structure of ros2_ws_bilal highlighted the necessity of organized workspaces for successful builds.
Learning to manage file permissions using chmod was essential for transforming my Python scripts into executable ROS 2 nodes.
I discovered that consistent workspace sourcing is vital, as the system cannot locate packages or executables without updated environment variables.
Troubleshooting path errors during the colcon build process significantly improved my technical command-line fluency in Ubuntu 22.04.
Successfully executing the simple_node and verifying it via ros2 run confirmed the integrity of my package configuration and entry points.
This lab has established a strong technical foundation that I will carry forward into next mobile robotics lab tasks.
